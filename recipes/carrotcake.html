            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil </li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 13x9-inch baking pan. </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. </li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Blend oil, sugar, eggs, and carrots in a blender, stopping to scrape down sides, until creamy and smooth, about 1 minute. Pour puree into a large bowl, then whisk in flour mixture until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer pan to a rack to cool, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Stir together milk, chocolate, honey, and butter in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth, thick, and reduced to about 1 1/8 cups, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Pour frosting into a metal bowl and set in a larger bowl of ice water. Stir frosting until cooled and thickened, about 5 minutes. Frost cake evenly and cut into 12 pieces to serve. </li>
